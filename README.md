# spark
Apache Spark Docker Image - an update of the Google Container Registry Spark Image

This container is based on gcr.io/google_containers/spark:1.5.2_v1. My main goal was to update the Spark version to the latest 2.3 stable, which is 2.3.2 at the time of this writing, and make an image that is a drop-in replacement for the GCR image.
